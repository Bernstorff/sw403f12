# IDEA:
# ^<action> <manipulates> <action parameters>* <context>$

add card to list

# translates to:
# i am doing "add" - manipulating the "card" - in the context of "list"
# the <bind> is only there to make the line more readable, and is not needed.
# generally, 		changing the <manipulate> by <action> it to the <context>
# specifically, 	changing the <card> by <adding> it to the <list>
# this works for all actions

remove card from list
add card to list
insert card at index 4 on list
