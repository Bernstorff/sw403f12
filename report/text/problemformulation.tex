\section{Initiating problem:}
How can a language remove the need for a pointing device when creating slide shows?

\chapter{Problem formulation}
The task of making a slide show in applications like Microsoft’s Power Point or Apple’s Keynote is a mouse based task. We want to create a programming language wherein a user can make a slide show presentation which is purely text based, and not have to think about the layout of single slides but only define the general layout. Furthermore, we want to display the presentation in a way so that it will look equal on all computers. \\
Challenges include creating a suitable domain specific language with weight on consistency and simplicity, enabling the user to focus on the content rather than the layout.
\\ \\
The following questions provide a limitation for the scope of the project:
\\ \\
Which platform should be used for presentation? \\
Who are the users of the language? \\
Which layout decisions does the user need? \\
What are the language limitations? \\
What can be expressed in the language? \\
