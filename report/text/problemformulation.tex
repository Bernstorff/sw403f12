\section{Initiating problem:}
How can it be made easier to prototype card games on a computer? 
\chapter{Problem formulation}
We want to create a domain specific language for card games to enable rapid prototyping. With a 
general programming language, trivial tasks would require much effort with little gain, since card 
representation and rule expressions would have to be written from the ground up. The language should be targeted at programmers with experience in imperative and object oriented programming. With a domain specific language we create an abstraction for these trivial tasks and enable the programmer to focus on the rules and behavior of the game, making prototyping easier and shortening the development time. 
Challenges include creating a suitable abstraction without limiting the number of games expressible
by the language, or creating an almost general-purpose language. The language should be easy to write and debug, since the focus is rapid prototyping.

The following questions provide a limitation for the scope of the project:

\begin{itemize}
\item How can we make a programming language for rapid prototyping card games ?
\item What does a programming language require to be domain specific ?
\item How should a domain specific language be structured ?
\end{itemize}
