\chapter{Lexer}

In order to create the syntax in chapter \ref{SSyntax}, tokens has to be identified for later use.
\\ \\
The tokens for the language is as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
format_kwd  = '@u' | '@b' | '@i' | '@apply' ;
space       = [\\s]+ ;
settingkwd  = '@setting' ;
beginkwd    = '@begin' ;
endkwd      = '@end' ;
atsign      = [@] ;
lcurly      = [\{] ;
rcurly      = [\}] ;
pipe        = [\|] ;
fslash      = [/] ;
bslash      = [\\] ;
colon       = [:] ;
scolon      = [;] ;
blist       = [\*] ;
nlist       = [#] ;
percent     = [%] ;
eol         = [\n|\r\n] ;
char        = ? [a-zA-Z_\.,]+ ? ;
digit       = ? [0-9]+ ? ;
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent{The abnormal in this token list is the \texttt{``settingkwd’’}, \texttt{``begindkwd’’} and \texttt{``endkwd’’} (kwd is short for: keyword). These keywords are explicit, because they are the keywords that differs from other keywords.}
\\ \\
The reason each special keyword has it’s own token, is to easily see the difference between the special tokens and the normal ones, without the need to check that a given token in the syntax analyser it is the right token.
\\ \\
\texttt{``Char’’} is used whenever characters needs to used in the code. Char is also used for plain text, which require it to have the symbols underscore, backlash, comma and period. \\
\texttt{``Digit’’} is used whenever numbers need to be used in the code. \\
When numbers or characters are expected, then one such has to occur at least once.
