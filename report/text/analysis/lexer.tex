\chapter{Lexer}

In order to create the syntax above, tokens has to be identified for later use.
\\ \\
The tokens for the language is as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
space  	   -> [\\s]+
settingkwd -> @setting
beginkwd   -> @begin
endkwd 	   -> @end 
atsign 	   -> [@]
lcurly 	   -> [{]
rcurly 	   -> [}] 
pipe   	   -> [|] 
fslash     -> [/]
bslash     -> [\]
colon  	   -> [:] 
scolon 	   -> [;] 
blist  	   -> [*] 
nlist  	   -> [#] 
percent	   -> [%] 
eol    	   -> [\n|\r\n] 
char   	   -> [a-zA-Z_\.,]+
digit  	   -> [0-9]+
\end{verbatim}

\noindent{The abnormal in this token list is the ``settingkwd’’, ``begindkwd’’ and ``endkwd’’ (kwd is short for: keyword). These keywords are explicit, because they are the keywords that differs from other keywords.}
\\ \\
The reason each special keyword has it’s own token, is to easily see the difference between the special tokens and the normal ones, without the need to check that a given token in the syntax analyser it is the right token.
\\ \\
``Char’’ is used whenever characters needs to used in the code. Char is also used for plain text, which require it to have the symbols underscore, backlash, comma and period. \\
``Digit’’ is used whenever numbers need to be used in the code. \\
When numbers or characters are expected, then one such has to occur at least once.
